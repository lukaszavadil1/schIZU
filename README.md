# Lazy TD-Learning algo for IZU project 3

## For extra lazy mfs.

## Usage
Throw in your assignment text file without changing any of its content
```bash
python schIZU.py < xplagi0b.txt > out.txt
```
That's it. It ain't much, but it's honest work.

## Doesn´t work?
It is recommended to use Python 3.x+

Replace xplagi0b.txt with the name of your input file

Make sure the encoding of the file is set to UTF-8

## Still doesn´t work?
